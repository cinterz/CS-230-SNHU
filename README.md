Summary of Client and Requirements
The Gaming Room is a client seeking a scalable and maintainable software solution to host and manage multiplayer trivia games. Their goal was to replicate the functionality of an existing Android-based game called "Draw It or Lose It" across multiple platforms, including web and iOS, while ensuring consistent game logic, user management, and session handling.

Strengths in Documentation
I excelled in clearly articulating the system architecture, breaking down components such as game logic, user interface, and data persistence. My use of diagrams and modular design principles helped convey the structure to both technical and nontechnical stakeholders.

Design Process and Its Impact on Development
Working through the design document forced me to think deeply about class responsibilities, data flow, and user interaction before writing any code. This upfront planning streamlined development and reduced rework, especially when implementing session management and platform-specific UI considerations.

Area for Improvement
If I were to revise one part, I’d refine the scalability section. While I addressed horizontal scaling and session isolation, I could improve by modeling load balancing strategies and database sharding options to support future growth.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I translated user needs—such as cross-platform accessibility, intuitive gameplay, and real-time responsiveness—into concrete design choices like RESTful APIs, responsive UI layouts, and asynchronous event handling. Prioritizing user needs ensures the software remains relevant, engaging, and usable.

Design Approach and Future Strategy
I approached design with a layered architecture mindset, separating concerns across presentation, logic, and data layers. In future projects, I’ll continue using UML diagrams, user stories, and iterative feedback loops to refine designs. I also plan to incorporate automated testing strategies earlier in the design phase to validate assumptions.
